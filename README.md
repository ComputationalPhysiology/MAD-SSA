# 3D Cardiac Statistical Shape Analysis Pipeline

This project provides a complete pipeline for processing 3D cardiac medical imaging data, from initial segmentation masks to statistical shape analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The pipeline generates 3D point clouds from segmentations, aligns them, and then performs PCA to identify primary modes of shape variation. Additionally, it includes scripts to create 3D meshes and evaluate their accuracy against the original data.

## üî≠ Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to automate the process of analyzing cardiac shapes from a cohort of subjects. The pipeline consists of the following major steps:

1.  **Point Cloud Generation**: Creates 3D point clouds of the endocardium and epicardium from `.h5` segmentation files.
2.  **Alignment**: Aligns the generated point clouds for all subjects to a common coordinate system. This step is crucial for meaningful comparison.
3.  **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Performs PCA on the aligned point clouds to identify the main patterns of shape variation across the subjects.
4.  **3D Mesh Creation**: (Optional) Generates a 3D mesh from a point cloud and computes error metrics by comparing it to the ground truth segmentation.

The entire process is contained in `main.py`, which runs the necessary scripts in sequence.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You will also need to install the required Python libraries. A `requirements.txt` file would be ideal for managing dependencies. Based on the imports, you'll need libraries such as ....

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/MAD-SSA.git
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib plotly meshio open3d h5py structlog opencv-python
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

This section explains how to use the scripts to process your data.

### Directory Structure

The scripts expect a specific directory structure, which is configured in `config.py`. You should have the following directories:

* `controls/ES_files_controls`: This is  where your subject data (in `.h5` format) is  stored.
  
Next, the script will generate:
* `controls/00_data/`: This is the **input directory** where your subject data point cloud result will be stored. Each subject should have its own subfolder.
* `Aligned_Models/`: This is the **output directory** for aligned point clouds.
* `controls/PCA_Results/`: This is the **output directory** for PCA results, including modes of variation and visualizations.
* `controls/settings/`: This contains the **fitting parameters** for the point cloud generation step.

### Running the Full Pipeline

The easiest way to run the entire pipeline is to execute the `main.py` script. This script will run the point cloud generation, alignment, and PCA in the correct order.

```bash
python main.py
```
### Individual Scripts

You can execute scripts individually:

| Script                | Description                                                | Usage                                       |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **`main_pc.py`** | Generates 3D point clouds from `.h5` segmentations.        | `python main_pc.py [--name <subject>]`      |
| **`alignment.py`** | Aligns all generated point clouds to a common origin.      | `python alignment.py`                       |
| **`pca.py`** | Runs PCA on aligned point clouds to find shape variations. | `python pca.py`                             |
| **`create_3d_mesh.py`** | Creates a 3D mesh and computes error metrics.            | `python create_3d_mesh.py --name <subject>` |



For more advanced control, especially over the point cloud generation process, you can modify the patient-specific settings files.

#### Adjusting LAX Curve Smoothing

You can control the smoothing level of the LAX curves for both the epicardium and endocardium. This is useful for fine-tuning the point cloud to better fit the source data.

* **How to adjust**: Modify the `lax_smooth_level_epi` and `lax_smooth_level_endo` values in the patient's corresponding JSON settings file.
* **Location**: These files are located in the directory specified by `SETTINGS_DIRECTORY` in `config.py` (e.g., `controls/settings/`).

**Example `settings/<patient_name>.json`:**

```json
{
    "mesh": {
        "fine": {
            "lax_smooth_level_epi": 80,
            "lax_smooth_level_endo": 50,
            "...": "..."
        }
    }
}
